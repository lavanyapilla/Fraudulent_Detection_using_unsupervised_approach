# Pycaret Framework
PyCaret is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within seconds in your choice of notebook environment.

PyCaret being a low-code library makes you more productive. With less time spent coding, you and your team can now focus on business problems.

PyCaret is simple and easy to use machine learning library that will help you to perform end-to-end ML experiments with less lines of code.

I solved this usecase by using pycaret Framework which makes solving problem easier and efficient.
